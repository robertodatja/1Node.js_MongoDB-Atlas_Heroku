CSS doesn't work after I deployed ToDoList in Heroku, the solution was updated in 2022!

Solution:

1. Make sure that inside your project folder (in our case todolist-v2  folder) you have:

   public folder ->  CSS folder -> styles.css file

2. Make sure that the inside header.ejs file you have:

  <link href="/CSS/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" >

3. Make sure that inside app.js you have:

  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

4. Go to HyperTerminal:

cd locationofProjectFolder

nodemon app.js

Ctrl+C

git add .

git commit -m "the problem is solved"

git push heroku master

5. Go to https://NameOfYourApp.herokuapp.com/
